 #PLN_warszawa_desc:0 "Warszawa, the crown jewel of the nation and the personal project of Walter. Here lies the adminstration and the bulk of the industry of the nation. With Walter developing it nonstop, the more the city develops—the less the people will want to go to war. As this is a project of great vanity, the people don't want to lose it to a foreign power."

Here lies the adminstration and the bulk of the industry of the nation. With Walter developing it nonstop, the more the city develops—the less the people will want to go to war. As this is a project of great vanity, the people don't want to lose it to a foreign power.\n\nDespite this, people are willing to defend it to any means necessary in a time of war. Polish members know the ins and outs of the city, every corner, every sewer and every window. Thus the defenders would have a huge advantage in a defending position. Weapon caches stored underground in Warszawa also mean, that the army can act autonomously without needing to rely on supply depot in another location."
